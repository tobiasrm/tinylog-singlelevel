# Tinylog Singlelevel Console Writer
A tinylog writer extension that allows to restrict writers to single log levels.
This may be used for nice loglevel dependent coloured console log or for debugging purposes (e.g. print out trace and debug levels but no higher ones).

Run `mvn clean install` and then `java -jar target/tinylog-singlelevel-1.3.1-executable.jar` for a demo (in an environment supporting colors via ASCII espace characters, e.g. bash terminal).

Check out `tinylog.properties` as configuration example.

***More explanations coming soon.***
